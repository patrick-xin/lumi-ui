<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Project & Install Base Theme">
    Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npx shadcn@latest init https://lumiui.dev/r/init.json
    ```

    This command initializes your project, installs the necessary dependencies, and sets up the base Lumi UI theme. It also configures a necessary CSS isolation rule (e.g., `root:isolete`) in your global styles.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Lumi UI Registry">
    Update your `component.json` file to include the Lumi UI component registry. This allows you to fetch Lumi UI components using the `npx shadcn-ui add` command.

    Add the following entry to your configuration:

    ```json title="component.json" {3-5}
    {
      // ... other configurations
      "registries": {
        "@lumi-ui": "https://lumiui.dev/r/{name}.json"
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Root Layout Wrapper">
    For the scoping and isolation (configured in Step 1) to work correctly, you must wrap your main application content in a `div` with the class name `root`.

    Update your main layout file (e.g., `layout.tsx` or similar) as follows:

    ```tsx title="layout.tsx" {2}
      <body>
        <div className="root">{children}</div>
      </body>
    ```

    This step ensures all Lumi UI styles are correctly scoped and isolated from the rest of your application. See [portals](https://base-ui.com/react/overview/quick-start#portals) from Base UI for more details.
