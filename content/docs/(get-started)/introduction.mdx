title: Introduction
description: Lumi UI is a composable React component system built to make customization effortless — powered by Base UI and Tailwind CSS.

Modern UI libraries have a tradeoff problem.

You either get **beautiful but rigid frameworks** that lock you into someone else’s design language — or **barebones primitives** that demand hours of setup just to look decent.

**Lumi UI** exists to end that tradeoff.

Built on [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) and styled with Tailwind CSS, Lumi gives you **complete control** over your design system — without losing accessibility, structure, or speed.

## Why Lumi?

Because “customizable” shouldn’t mean “start from scratch.”

Lumi bridges the gap between *unstyled primitives* and *fully themed systems*:
- **Composed, not abstracted** – Every component is plain React, easy to read, and easy to change.  
- **Styled your way** – Lumi ships polished defaults, but everything runs through your Tailwind tokens.  
- **Grounded in accessibility** – Base UI handles ARIA, focus, keyboard, and motion for you.  
- **No lock-in** – Copy the code, tweak it, ship it. You own every line.  

Lumi isn’t a framework. It’s a **foundation for creative UI systems** — a way to build interfaces that feel consistent, yet unmistakably yours.

## Philosophy

### 1. Code Ownership
Install nothing. Copy everything.  
You get the source — clean, typed, and modifiable.  
No runtime dependency, no black box.

### 2. Composable, Predictable Patterns
Every component follows the same structure:
- Root → Trigger → Popup → Content (and so on)  
- Consistent prop naming  
- Unified TypeScript signatures  
- Shared class and slot conventions  

### 3. Accessible by Default
Accessibility isn’t a feature — it’s the baseline.  
Base UI handles interaction logic and ARIA roles, so you can focus on the design layer.

### 4. Diversity by Design
The web doesn’t need more lookalikes.  
Lumi’s mission is to **make it easier to look different** — to let teams build their own visual language without reinventing interaction logic.
