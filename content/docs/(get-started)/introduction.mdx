## Illuminate your interface.

Composable React components powered by Base UI and Tailwind CSS — built for clarity, speed, and total code ownership.

**Beautifully designed components built with Base UI primitives that you can copy and paste into your apps.**


Lumi UI is an open-source React component system that merges the accessibility and structure of Base UI  with the design freedom of Tailwind CSS.

It’s inspired by shadcn/ui’s philosophy — copy, not install — but reimagined for modern teams who want to stay close to the metal, not trapped in frameworks.


Lumi UI — Composable, accessible React components built with Base UI and Tailwind.
Copy, customize, and ship beautiful interfaces with your own design system.

Think of Lumi UI as your design starter kit:

Unstyled foundation: Base UI primitives handle accessibility and interaction.

Tailwind styling: Use your own design tokens, colors, and spacing.

Design layer: Elegant defaults that look polished out-of-the-box but stay fully editable.

Own your code: No runtime dependency. Every component is yours.

## What is Lumi UI?

Lumi UI is a collection of re-usable components built using **Base UI** primitives and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. 

It's **not a component library**. It's a collection of components that you can copy into your apps and customize to your needs.

### Why Lumi UI?


#### What it is
- A collection of copy-paste components
- Built on Base UI (MUI's unstyled primitives)
- Fully customizable and owned by you
- Compatible with shadcn/ui API patterns
- TypeScript-first with strict types
- Accessible by default (WCAG compliant)

#### What it's not
- Not an npm package to install
- Not a traditional UI library
- Not opinionated about styling
- Not locked into specific versions



## Why Base UI over Radix?

Lumi UI uses **Base UI** instead of Radix UI primitives, offering several advantages:

### Performance
- **Smaller bundle size** – Base UI components are more lightweight
- **Modern React patterns** – Built for React 18/19 with concurrent features
- **Better tree-shaking** – Import only what you need

### Developer Experience  
- **MUI ecosystem** – Backed by MUI's proven track record
- **Comprehensive docs** – Detailed API references and examples
- **Active maintenance** – Regular updates and improvements

### Compatibility
- **shadcn-like API** – Familiar patterns if you've used shadcn/ui
- **Easy migration** – Simple path from shadcn components
- **Flexible composition** – Use `render` prop instead of `asChild`

## Comparison with shadcn/ui

| Feature | Lumi UI | shadcn/ui |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Primitives | Base UI | Radix UI |
| API Style | shadcn-compatible | shadcn native |
| Installation | Copy & paste | Copy & paste |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Tailwind CSS |
| TypeScript | Full support | Full support |
| Next.js 15 | Optimized | Supported |
| Server Components | Where possible | Where possible |

## Philosophy

### Own Your Code
Every component is yours to modify. No need to fork or eject – just edit the files directly.

### Consistency
All components follow the same patterns:
- Predictable prop names
- Consistent styling approach
- Unified TypeScript types
- Standard composition patterns

### Accessibility First
Built on Base UI's accessible primitives:
- ARIA attributes included
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Focus management

### Framework Agnostic (Styling)
While we use Tailwind CSS, you can:
- Use CSS Modules
- Use CSS-in-JS (Emotion, styled-components)
- Use any styling solution
- Mix and match approaches

## Use Cases

### Perfect for:
- New Next.js projects seeking Base UI primitives
- Teams wanting full component ownership
- Projects requiring deep customization
- Apps needing smaller bundle sizes
- Developers familiar with shadcn patterns

### Consider alternatives if:
- You need a plug-and-play component library
- You prefer Radix UI primitives specifically
- You don't want to maintain component code
- You need components that update automatically
