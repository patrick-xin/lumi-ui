**Lumi UI** is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible React components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

It is built on top of [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It's not a component library. Instead, you can think of it as a collection of components that you can copy and paste into your apps and customize to your needs.

## Why Lumi UI?

Lumi UI offers a unique blend of features that make it an ideal choice for modern web development:

- **shadcn-Compatible**: If you're familiar with shadcn/ui, you'll feel right at home with Lumi UI's API patterns.
- **Copy & Paste Integration**: Seamlessly integrate components into your project by copying them directly.
- **Accessible by Default**: Built on Base UI's WCAG-compliant primitives, ensuring accessibility is a core feature.
- **Fully Customizable**: Take complete ownership of your code. Modify and adapt components without the need to eject or fork.
- **Native TypeScript Support**: Enjoy the benefits of strict typing and an excellent developer experience from the start.

## Philosophy

### Own Your Code

Every component is yours to shape. There's no need to navigate complex abstraction layersâ€”simply edit the files directly to match your vision.

### Optimized Developer Experience

With polished preset designs, customization is straightforward and intuitive, allowing you to focus on what matters most.

### Accessibility First

Leveraging Base UI's accessible primitives, Lumi UI components come with ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support built-in.
