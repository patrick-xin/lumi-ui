## Illuminate your interface.

Lumi UI is an open-source React component system that merges the accessibility and structure of Base UI  with the design freedom of Tailwind CSS.

It's inspired by shadcn/ui's philosophy — copy, not install — but reimagined for modern teams who want to stay close to the metal, not trapped in frameworks.

Think of Lumi UI as your design starter kit:

- Unstyled foundation: Base UI primitives handle accessibility and interaction.
- Tailwind styling: Use your own design tokens, colors, and spacing.
- Design layer: Elegant defaults that look polished out-of-the-box but stay fully editable.
- Own your code: No runtime dependency. Every component is yours.

#### What it is
- A collection of copy-paste components
- Built on Base UI (MUI's unstyled primitives)
- Fully customizable and owned by you
- Compatible with shadcn/ui API patterns
- TypeScript-first with strict types
- Accessible by default (WCAG compliant)

#### What it's not
- Not an npm package to install
- Not a traditional UI library
- Not opinionated about styling
- Not locked into specific versions

## Philosophy

### Own Your Code
Every component is yours to modify. No need to fork or eject – just edit the files directly.

### Consistency
All components follow the same patterns:
- Predictable prop names
- Consistent styling approach
- Unified TypeScript types
- Standard composition patterns

### Accessibility First
Built on Base UI's accessible primitives:
- ARIA attributes included
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Focus management
