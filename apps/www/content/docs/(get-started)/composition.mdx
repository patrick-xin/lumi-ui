## A Flexible Foundation

In Base UI, composition is powered by a single, flexible concept: the **`render` prop**. This approach provides a clear and explicit way to customize the underlying structure of a component without sacrificing accessibility or functionality.

Think of it as a designated slot where you can plug in your own custom element or React component, giving you complete control over the final rendered output.

### Changing the Default Element

At its core, the `render` prop lets you replace the default HTML element of a component with one of your own.

Every Base UI component renders the most appropriate element by default (e.g., a `<button>` for a trigger, a `<div>` for a menu item). However, you might need a `Menu.Item` to act as a link. The `render` prop makes this trivial.

```tsx title="components/my-navigation.tsx"
import { Menu } from '@/lib/components/menu';
import { Button } from '@/lib/components/button';

export default function MyNavigation() {
  return (
    <Menu.Root>
      <Menu.Trigger render={<Button variant="outline" />}>
        Navigate
      </Menu.Trigger>
      <Menu.Portal>
        <Menu.Positioner>
          <Menu.Popup>
            {/* The Menu.Item now renders as an <a> tag */}
            <Menu.Item render={<a href="/home" />}>
              Home
            </Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item render={<a href="/settings" />}>
              Settings
            </Menu.Item>
          </Menu.Popup>
        </Menu.Positioner>
      </Menu.Portal>
    </Menu.Root>
  );
}
```

## Coming from Radix UI

If you're used to Radix UI, you're likely familiar with the `asChild` prop. The `render` prop in Base UI serves the same fundamental purpose — composing components — but with a slightly different and more explicit mental model.

| Concept | Radix UI (`asChild`) | Base UI (`render`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Merge props with an immediate child component. | Replace the default element with a new one. |
| **Syntax** | The custom component is placed *inside* as a child. | The custom element is passed *to* the `render` prop. |

Let's compare how you'd make a `Button` component behave like a link.

#### Radix UI (`asChild`)

With `asChild`, the `Button`'s props are merged onto its direct descendant.

```tsx title="Radix UI Example"
// The <Button>'s props are passed down to the <a> tag.
<Button asChild>
  <a href="/profile">View Profile</a>
</Button>
```

#### Base UI (`render`)

With `render`, you provide the element that the `Button` should render *as*. The children are passed through as normal.

```tsx title="Base UI Example"
// The <Button> renders an <a> tag instead of a <button>.
<Button render={<a href="/profile" />}>
  View Profile
</Button>
```

The `render` prop is intentionally explicit. It makes the component's structure clear at a glance and avoids the ambiguity that can sometimes arise from implicit prop merging.

## Advanced Composition

The `render` prop's flexibility extends beyond just changing HTML tags.

### Composing with Custom Components

The most powerful use case for `render` is composing Base UI primitives with your own custom React components. For example, you can use a custom, styled `NextLink` component as a `Menu.Trigger`.

```tsx title="components/MyComponent.tsx"
import { Link } from '@/lib/components/next-link';
import { Menu } from '@/lib/components/menu';

<Menu.Trigger render={<NextLink href="/docs" />}>
  Documentation
</Menu.Trigger>
```

### Using a Render Function for State Control

For maximum control, you can pass a function to the `render` prop instead of a React element. This is ideal for performance-critical scenarios or when you need to render different content based on the component's internal state.

The function receives two arguments: `props` (the props to be spread) and `state` (an object containing the component's current state).

For example, you could render a different icon inside a `Switch.Thumb` based on its `checked` state:

```tsx title="components/my-switch.tsx"
import { Switch } from '@/lib/components/switch';
import { CheckIcon, CloseIcon } from '@/lib/icons';

<Switch.Thumb
  render={(props, state) => (
    <span {...props}>
      {state.checked ? <CheckIcon /> : <CloseIcon />}
    </span>
  )}
/>
```

This pattern gives you direct access to the component's machinery, allowing for powerful and dynamic compositions while staying true to Base UI's philosophy of keeping you close to the metal.
