## About
This form implementation is built on top of Base UI Form and Base UI Field. It leverages the native Constraint Validation API, meaning you can often build robust forms without needing external libraries like React Hook Form or Zod, though they are fully supported.

## Anatomy
```tsx
<Form>
  <Field>
    <FieldLabel /> 
    <FieldControl />
    <FieldDescription />
    <FieldError />
  </Field>
  <Button type="submit"/>
</Form>
```

## Basic Usage
```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import {
  Field,
  FieldControl,
  FieldDescription,
  FieldError,
  FieldLabel,
} from "@/components/ui/field";
import { Form } from "@/components/ui/form";

export const BasicForm = () => {
  return (
    <Form onFormSubmit={(value) => console.log(value)}>
      <Field name="username">
        <FieldLabel>Username</FieldLabel>
        <FieldControl minLength={3} required />
        <FieldDescription>Public display name.</FieldDescription>
        <FieldError />
      </Field>
      <Button>Submit</Button>
    </Form>
  );
};
```
