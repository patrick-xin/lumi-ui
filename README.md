## What is Lumi UI?
Lumi UI gives you production-ready React components with a unique twist: every component comes in two flavors.

- **Composites** - Pre-assembled components for rapid development
- **Primitives** - Granular building blocks for complete control

Start fast with composites, drop down to primitives when you need custom layouts. No compromises.

## Why Lumi UI?
- Accessibility built-in - ARIA, keyboard navigation, and focus management handled by Base UI
- Complete code ownership - Copy components into your project, modify freely
- Dual-layer architecture - Choose between speed (composites) and control (primitives)
- AI-friendly - Flat exports and clear patterns optimize for AI-assisted development
- Themeable - Uses shadcn/ui's CSS variable system for easy customization
- TypeScript - Fully typed with excellent IntelliSense support

## Key Concepts

### The Hit-Test Philosophy
Interactive areas are forgiving. We use pseudo-elements to separate visual highlights from clickable regions, creating a more natural UX.

### AI-Assisted Development
Flat semantic exports and composites as living examples help AI assistants generate correct, idiomatic code on the first try.

### Unified Design Language
Shared animation utilities and consistent interaction patterns across all components.
