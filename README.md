## ✨ What is Lumi UI?

Lumi UI is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible React components built with Base UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS. It's not a component library — it's a collection of components that you can copy into your apps and customize to your needs.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **🎭 shadcn-Compatible**: If you're familiar with shadcn/ui, you'll feel right at home with Lumi UI's API patterns.
- **🎨 Copy & Paste Integration**: Seamlessly integrate components into your project by copying them directly.
- **♿ Accessible by Default**: Built on Base UI's WCAG-compliant primitives, ensuring accessibility is a core feature.
- **🎛️ Fully Customizable**: Take complete ownership of your code. Modify and adapt components without the need to eject or fork.
- **🔧 Native TypeScript Support**: Enjoy the benefits of strict typing and an excellent developer experience from the start.

## 🎯 Our Philosophy

### Own Your Code

Every component is yours to shape. There's no need to navigate complex abstraction layers—simply edit the files directly to match your vision.

### Optimized Developer Experience

With polished preset designs, customization is straightforward and intuitive, allowing you to focus on what matters most.

### Accessibility First

Leveraging Base UI's accessible primitives, Lumi UI components come with ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support built-in.
